3. Which web tool has impressed you the most and why?
React is the one which impresses me the most. It's easy to start with, can build reusable components, fast render due to virtual DOM.
React allows us to create SPA that can change data, without reloading the page. The main purpose of React is to be fast, scalable, and simple.   

4. Given a web application, how do you choose a JS framework to solve?
I would first check the requirements of the project and depending on some factors like is it fast enough or not, ease of installation, familiarity with the framework and scalability.

5. How much of the Unix command line are you familiar with? Give some examples.
I've always worked on linux system, so I'm quite familiar with terminal.
I know commands related to installation, directories, interaction with git e.g. sudo, cd, ls, mkdir, pwd, etc.
